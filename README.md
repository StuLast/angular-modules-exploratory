# Angular with Semantic UI Exploration

This is a little project that pulls together varios aspects of Semantic UI and implements them as reusable components in an Angular framework web-app.  This is purely a demonstration, but can also provide sample reuseable components for future projects, if using Semantic UI.

This web application doesn't do anything useful.  No data is collected, processed or stored by this web application.  All content is static and included in the demo web app.

# Angular Stuff...

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
